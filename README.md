# Aircraft-Noise-Complaints-A-Data-Driven-Approach

**Acknowledgements**


I would like to personally thank both my supervisors, Dr Zhang Wei and Dr Liu Fang for giving me the opportunity to do this project. Coming from a non-data science background, they provided me with insights and explained certain concepts and terminologies of which helped me throughout the entire project.
This project would not have been possible without the constant guidance from both of my supervisors. Despite their busy schedules, both of them allocated time after office hours for our weekly meetings. Those weekly meetings were very meaningful because it got me on track whenever I seemed to be deviating away from the main objectives.
I would also like to extend my gratitude to Bert Ganoung and Dave Ong of San Francisco International Airport Noise Abatement Office for taking the time to produce a dataset that I require for my capstone project.
And lastly, to my course mates Dhanie Ardiyan and Luqman Hakim, thank you for the invaluable suggestions and unwavering support throughout the entire duration of the project.

**1.1 Project Objectives**

This project aims to discover and understand any underlying factors behind an aircraft noise related complaint through the use of data analytics techniques. The project objectives are divided into three different key factors:

• The first factor seeks for any association between the place of residence and the number of complaints generated

• The second factor assesses for factors pertaining to the aircraft such as the altitude and the time at which it is flying and the impact it brings to the residents living near the airport

• The third factor analyses for any significant relationships between non-acoustical factors and the annoyance level of residents

**1.2 Problem Statement**

As the world shrinks via the seamless connectivity of air travel, the number of complaints received by noise abatement offices increases. The cause for this points to the increasing frequency of aircraft flying over residential areas either for taking off or landing. In 2018 alone, there were a total of 8.8 billion passengers carried by the airlines. This number was projected to increase to over 19.7 billion passengers come 2040 (Coleman, 2019).
Quality of health and life is known to be negatively impacted with increasing noise exposure. Despite the exposure already being considered as an essential part of daily living, prolonged and even excessive noise exposure could prove detrimental to human health. Some of the harmful outcomes with prolonged noise exposure include sleep (Nassur, 2019), high-blood pressure (Gerolymatou, 2019) and stress (Black, 2007).
With the necessary infrastructure available, airport noise abatement offices at various airports around the world used these collected data to plot out the noise exposure contour. (Zaporozhets, 2019) reports that airports achieved this through constant noise level and exposure monitoring at designated areas. These noise exposure contour helps form “basis for noise zoning policies and land-use planning decisions” to minimise the population affected by aircraft noise as reported by (Zaporozhets, 2019).

To understand the concerns of the community with regards to the exposure of aircraft noise, majority of studies, specifically in (Sung, 2016) & (Collette, 2011), had conducted surveys and questionnaires that link the different socio-demographic factors such as age, income and education level with the human annoyance level. Tapping into this data would provide some understanding into the concerns of a particular community with regards to the aircraft noise produced. This data, however, may not entirely reveal the reasoning behind why anyone might want to lodge a complaint based on the aircraft noise.
Is it the distance between their residential area to the airport? Or is the aircraft circling particularly around the person’s residential area as instructed by the Air Traffic Controller (ATC)? These are some of the questions in which this project aims to answer. This would mean exploring other potential reasons and drawing hypotheses as to what might trigger one to complain in the first place. Through the use of statistical analysis, the project will measure the significance level of the relationship between each variable and determine if further analysis would be required. Visualisation to enhance the understanding of such relationships would be done by utilising the Python programming language.
